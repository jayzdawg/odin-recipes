    <h2>A simple, healthy, quick and most importantly, delicious kitchadi dish</h2>
    <p>Khichdi, also known as Kitchadi, is a traditional Indian comfort food that has deep roots in Ayurvedic medicine. This dish is essentially a one-pot meal made from a simple combination of rice and lentils (commonly mung beans), which are cooked together with spices and sometimes vegetables. The beauty of khichdi lies in its simplicity and versatility, offering a balanced blend of proteins, carbohydrates, and fibers, making it easily digestible and incredibly nourishing. Above all, Kitchadi is known to balance all the three doshas. </p>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 cup mung dal (split yellow)</li>
        <li>6 cups (approx.) water</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 inch ginger root chopped or grated</li>
        <li>A bit of mineral salt (1/4 tsp. or so)</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ghee</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. cumin powder </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. whole cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups assorted vegetables (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Carefully pick over rice and dal to remove any stones. Wash each separately in at least 2 changes of water.</li>
        <li>Add the 6 cups of water to the rice and dal and cook covered until it becomes soft, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While that is cooking, prepare any vegetables that suit your constitution. Cut them into smallish pieces. Add the vegetables to the cooked rice and dal mixture and cook 10 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, sauté the seeds in the ghee until they pop. Then add the other spices. Stir together to release the flavors.</li>
        <li>Stir the sautéed spices into the cooked dal, rice, and vegetable mixture. Add the mineral salt and chopped fresh cilantro and serve.</li>
    </ol>
